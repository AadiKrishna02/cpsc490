# Drug Trafficking in Colombia

## Introduction

Drug trafficking in Colombia has been a significant issue affecting the nation's security, economy, and international relations. From the dominance of notorious cartels in the 1980s to the ongoing challenges with drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), Colombia's struggle against narcotics trade has been profound and complex. This page provides an exhaustive overview of the drug trafficking landscape in Colombia, supported by declassified FOIA documents.

## Historical Context

### 1980s to Mid-1990s: The Rise of the Cartels

During the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, Colombia was nearly brought to its knees by powerful cartels, most notably the Medellín and Cali cartels. These organizations wielded tremendous power, often using violence to maintain control and influence over the state <a href="/documents/DIAjmicMstersTheses1973-97_2002#page=52" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2002, p.52)</a>. The influence of these cartels was so pervasive that they controlled large portions of the cocaine market, shipping drugs into the United States via various routes, including across the Caribbean and through Mexico <a href="/documents/DIA_FileId_238885#page=65" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #238885, p.65)</a>.

### Plan Colombia and Beyond

In response to the drug-fueled violence and corruption, Colombia, with the support of the United States, implemented Plan Colombia in 2000. This initiative aimed to reduce drug production and trafficking, restore security, and promote economic development <a href="/documents/USAIDpresidentTransDocs_2016#page=241" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2016, p.241)</a>. The strategy included military and police actions, as well as crop substitution programs, which proved effective in dismantling some of the major trafficking networks <a href="/documents/VOA-Legacy-Assets_2011#page=3020" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2011, p.3020)</a>.

## Key Findings and Ongoing Issues

### Shifts in Trafficking Dynamics

While the power of the large cartels has diminished, smaller and more fragmented drug trafficking organizations (known locally as BACRIM) have taken their place. These groups continue to pose challenges as they adapt and evolve in response to law enforcement efforts <a href="/documents/DEAintelPubs2015-2023#page=42" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #DEAintelPubs2015-2023, p.42)</a>.

### Extradition and International Cooperation

Extradition has been a crucial tool in the fight against drug trafficking. Notable cases include the extradition of traffickers like Luis Hernando Gomez Bustamante, who was deported from Cuba to Colombia and later extradited to the United States <a href="/documents/Corres_OFAC-FinCEN_2005-2007#page=29" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2005-2007, p.29)</a>. This reflects the international dimension of Colombia's drug trafficking problem and the need for cross-border cooperation.

### Impact on Society and Governance

Drug trafficking continues to impact Colombian society significantly, contributing to violence, corruption, and challenges in governance. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and other insurgent groups have historically funded their activities through drug trafficking, complicating efforts to achieve lasting peace and security <a href="/documents/DIA_FileId_238797#page=110" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #238797, p.110)</a>.

## Conclusion

Colombia's battle with drug trafficking is a testament to the complexities of addressing transnational crime. Despite significant progress, challenges remain as traffickers adapt to enforcement measures. Continued cooperation between Colombia and international partners is essential to mitigate the impact of drug trafficking on both national and global scales.
