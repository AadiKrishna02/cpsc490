## Overview

Counterinsurgency in Colombia has been a complex and multifaceted effort aimed at addressing the long-standing insurgency that has plagued the nation for decades. The Colombian government, alongside various military and paramilitary groups, has engaged in operations against insurgent factions, primarily the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=10" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.10)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-10)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_239269#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #239269, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_239269-3). The conflict has been characterized by a blend of military action, political maneuvering, and socio-economic strategies to undermine insurgent support [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=8" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.8)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-8)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=6" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.6)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-6).

## Background

Colombia's insurgency has roots in a history of political factionalism and social inequality, which has fostered a climate of violence and instability [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=10" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.10)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-10). The National Front, a power-sharing agreement between the Liberal and Conservative parties established in 1958, aimed to mitigate political conflict but inadvertently contributed to the rise of insurgent groups by failing to address the needs of marginalized populations [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=10" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.10)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-10)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=6" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.6)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-6). The FARC, founded in 1966, emerged as the largest insurgent group, initially motivated by Marxist ideology but later adopting more pragmatic demands focused on local issues [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=10" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.10)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-10)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_239269#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #239269, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_239269-3).

## Key Organizations/Entities

The primary insurgent groups in Colombia include the FARC and the ELN. The FARC, with its origins in the 1960s, has evolved from a Marxist guerrilla group into a more complex organization involved in drug trafficking and local governance [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=11" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.11)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-11)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_239269#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #239269, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_239269-3). The ELN, established in 1964, has also been involved in similar activities, advocating for the nationalization of resources and social justice [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=11" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.11)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-11)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_239269#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #239269, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_239269-3). On the government side, the Colombian Army (COLAR) plays a crucial role in counterinsurgency operations, supported by police forces and various paramilitary groups [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=23" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.23)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-23)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=22" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.22)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-22).

## Operations and Activities

Counterinsurgency operations in Colombia have involved a combination of military strategies, civil-military cooperation, and humanitarian efforts aimed at winning the loyalty of the population [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=8" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.8)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-8)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=6" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.6)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-6). The Colombian military has focused on isolating insurgents from their support bases, employing tactics that include direct engagement in combat, intelligence operations, and community outreach programs [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=8" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.8)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-8)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=23" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.23)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-23). Notably, President Ernesto Samper emphasized the multifaceted nature of the challenge, requiring simultaneous efforts against drug trafficking, guerrilla warfare, and maintaining public order [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238746#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #238746, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238746-3)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=22" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.22)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-22).

## Analysis and Assessment

The effectiveness of Colombia's counterinsurgency strategy has been a subject of debate. While military operations have resulted in significant gains against insurgent forces, issues such as human rights abuses and the intertwining of military and paramilitary actions have raised concerns [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238746#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #238746, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238746-3)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=22" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.22)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-22). Reports indicate that human rights violations have been committed not only by insurgents but also by security forces, complicating the narrative of the conflict [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238746#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #238746, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238746-3)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=22" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.22)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-22). The Colombian military's operational tempo has increased under various administrations, reflecting a commitment to intensifying counterinsurgency efforts [<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238746#page=3" class="citation">(Doc #238746, p.3)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238746-3)[<a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238678#page=22" class="citation">(Doc #238678, p.22)</a>](#cite-DIA_FileId_238678-22).
