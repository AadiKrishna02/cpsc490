# CIA Coup in Iran (1953)

## Introduction

The 1953 coup in Iran, known as Operation Ajax, was a pivotal event orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. This operation is widely regarded as a significant moment in the history of U.S.-Iran relations, leading to long-lasting consequences for both countries. The coup restored the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to power, ultimately setting the stage for the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

## Historical Context

### Pre-Coup Iran

In the early 20th century, Iran was a country rich in natural resources, particularly oil. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), a British company, controlled the majority of Iranian oil production. The nationalization movement began in the early 1950s, led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who sought to transfer control of the oil industry from foreign hands to the Iranian government. This move directly threatened British economic interests, leading to heightened tensions between Iran and the UK.

### Nationalization of Oil

In March 1951, Mossadegh's government nationalized the oil industry, prompting a British-led boycott that severely damaged Iran’s economy. The British government, in response to Mossadegh's actions, sought support from the United States to orchestrate a coup and restore the Shah, who had been increasingly sidelined by the growing power of Mossadegh and his government.

## The Coup: Operation Ajax

### Planning and Execution

The CIA and SIS embarked on a covert operation, codenamed Operation Ajax, to remove Mossadegh from power. The planning included propaganda campaigns, economic sabotage, and the mobilization of street protests. 

1. **Preparation**: In early 1953, the CIA devised a plan to portray Mossadegh as a communist sympathizer, thereby justifying U.S. intervention. The agency leveraged the existing anti-communist sentiment during the Cold War to gain support for their activities in Iran. 

2. **Economic Sabotage**: The British government froze Iranian assets in London and orchestrated a boycott of Iranian oil. This action further destabilized the Iranian economy and increased public discontent against Mossadegh.

3. **Mobilization of Pro-Shah Forces**: The CIA coordinated with pro-Shah military officers and organized street mobs to create chaos in Tehran. The plan involved arming these groups and providing them with logistical support to stage protests against Mossadegh’s government.

### The Coup Day

On August 19, 1953, the coup was executed. Initial attempts to arrest Mossadegh failed, and he remained in power for several hours. However, as the day progressed, the tide turned against him. Pro-Shah forces, backed by the CIA's support, mobilized successfully, leading to the eventual overthrow of Mossadegh.

### Aftermath

The coup resulted in the reinstatement of the Shah, who ruled with an increasingly autocratic style. The operation deepened anti-American sentiment in Iran and created a legacy of distrust that would culminate in the Iranian Revolution of 1979.
