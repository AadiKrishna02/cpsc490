# CIA in Afghanistan

## Introduction
- The Central Intelligence Agency’s involvement in Afghanistan spans from the Soviet–Afghan War through the post-9/11 counterterrorism era, encompassing covert assistance to Afghan fighters, intelligence network building, and later integration with international security efforts. <a href="/pdf/ODNIcovertOps1800s2007#page=15" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #ODNIcovertOps1800s2007, p.15)</a> <a href="/pdf/CIA-comments_1994-2005u#page=151" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #1994-2005u, p.151)</a>
- Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. operations targeted Al Qaeda sanctuaries in Afghanistan, a campaign in which CIA covert activities were pivotal to the broader effort and helped raise the stature of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet with President George W. Bush. <a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238567#page=105" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #238567, p.105)</a>
- The rapid U.S. shift after 9/11 relied on long-standing CIA groundwork in Afghanistan, including networks of human intelligence (HUMINT) sources and preexisting relationships with Afghan actors. By September 10, 2001, the CIA reportedly had more than one hundred sources and subsources operating in the country. <a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238567#page=105" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #238567, p.105)</a>

## Historical Context
- Pre-9/11, the CIA remained active in Afghanistan even after the Soviet withdrawal, working to expand its HUMINT footprint and maintain influence in a volatile security environment. <a href="/pdf/GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971#page=18" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #1971, p.18)</a> <a href="/documents/GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971_chunk4" class="citation" target="_blank">[GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971_chunk4]</a>
- In the 1980s, the agency supported Afghan mujahideen as part of a broader U.S. effort against Soviet influence, using Pakistan as a conduit for money and weapons; this period is documented as a key antecedent to later Afghanistan operations. <a href="/pdf/ODNIcovertOps1800s2007#page=15" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #ODNIcovertOps1800s2007, p.15)</a> <a href="/pdf/CIA-comments_1994-2005u#page=151" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #1994-2005u, p.151)</a>
- The post–Soviet landscape featured ongoing U.S. coordination among diplomatic, military, and intelligence actors, laying the groundwork for a more formal security architecture in Afghanistan. This included U.S. ambassadorial coordination and the country-team concept described in early-generation GAO analyses. <a href="/documents/GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971_chunk4" class="citation" target="_blank">[GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971_chunk4]</a> <a href="/pdf/GAOreportUSPgmsInAfghanistan_1971#page=18" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #1971, p.18)</a>

## Organizational Framework and Structures
- The Office of Security Cooperation – Afghanistan (OSC-A) evolved from the Office of Military Cooperation – Afghanistan (OMC-A), with its mandate expanding to include policing and later transforming into the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A). <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=147" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.147)</a> <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=133" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.133)</a>
- CIA operations in Afghanistan have operated in close conjunction with ISAF and Afghan government security institutions, integrating intelligence collection with security sector reform and governance efforts. <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=133" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.133)</a> <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=148" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.148)</a>

## Core Operations and Capabilities
- Intelligence collection in Afghanistan relied on an expansive HUMINT network, built in the years leading to and after 9/11, enabling the CIA to leverage local sources for targeting Al Qaeda and other insurgent networks. By 9/11/2001, the CIA had a substantial staff of sources and sub-sources across Afghanistan. <a href="/pdf/DIA_FileId_238567#page=105" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #238567, p.105)</a>
- CIA operational concepts included rebuilding contacts with the Northern Alliance and engaging tribal elements to gather intelligence and facilitate operations against high-value targets, including Osama bin Laden. <a href="/pdf/ODNIcovertOps1800s2007#page=15" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #ODNIcovertOps1800s2007, p.15)</a>
- The post-9/11 mission integrated multiple layers of security and rule-of-law considerations, including the need for intelligence-informed stabilization and governance activities in Afghanistan. This framework is reflected in discussions of security cooperation, training, and law-enforcement capacity-building. <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=133" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.133)</a> <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=147" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.147)</a>
- Legal and strategic rationales cited to justify ongoing operations included maintaining the Afghan government’s capacity to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist training ground, consistent with statements from U.S. leadership. <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=133" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.133)</a>

## Legal and Policy Context
- Post-2001, the Bonn Agreement and U.N. Security Council resolutions provided the international legal scaffolding for provisional arrangements in Afghanistan, shaping the environment in which CIA and U.S. agencies operated. <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=92" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.92)</a>
- The broader legal framework for operation and engagement included principles of self-defense and UN-mandated security arrangements under ISAF, as discussed in international-law-oriented sections of the declassified material. <a href="/pdf/ForgedInTheFire_2008#page=133" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.133)</a>
- U.S. oversight and interagency coordination were part of ongoing discussions in the 2000s, as exemplified by correspondence and policy notes that address the classification and review process for sensitive Afghanistan-related materials. <a href="/pdf/CorresOLC-Kavanaugh_2001-2006#page=826" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2001-2006, p.826)</a> <a href="/pdf/StateInfoPgmsRpts_2008#page=172" class="citation" target="_blank">(Doc #2008, p.172)</a>
